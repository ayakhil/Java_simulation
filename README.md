Assume a network device processes 3 types of messages, each with different amount of complexity. Congestion is detected when the total number of messages in the queue exceeds a threshold. We want to compare two types of congestion control. First type is to drop (not process) all messages belonging to a type of message with max mean service type. Then wait for a predefined amount of time. If congestion persists after this time period, all messages belonging to the next type of message with highest mean service time will be dropped, and so on until congestion is abated. Second type is to drop a percentage of all messages arrived regardless of their service time, and similar to the first type of congestion control wait for a predefined amount of time to determine the congestion state and if it persists increase the percentage of message drop.
